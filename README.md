# go-benchmarks

Random Go Benchmarks

## How to Use

Each folder contains a benchmark I've done in the past with code, tests, benchmarks, and results.

Feel free to clone and run the benchmarks on your own. There is a standard way of running each benchmark.

## Commands in each folder

Each folder has a `Makefile` with the following commands available:

### Running Benchmarks

```
$ make bench
```

### Running Tests

```
$ make test
```

### Running Escape Analysis

```
$ make analysis
```

### Help?

```
$ make help
```
